# Change Settings to our Woke-atorium PZ Server
You will need a code editor like VSCode and a github email for me to add you as a collaborator.

Another benefit of this is that there is an automated deployment of the Settings files to G-Portal whenever there's a merge to the main branch. The server will need to be shutdown first then we can upload the changes from this repository instantly.
# How to add Mods
To add **mods **to the server use these entries inside the **servertest.ini**

#### Examples:

`    WorkshopItems=2169435993;2831715487`<br/>
`    Mods=tsarslib;ATA_Bus`

## Some Mods
Mods that are a little extra require more supporting files there is a Mods folder inside the to-upload area that you'll need to place the raw files in.
